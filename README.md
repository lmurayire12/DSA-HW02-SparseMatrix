# "Sparse Matrix Python Program"

## Overview
This Python program allows you to perform various operations on sparse matrices, including addition, subtraction, and multiplication. Sparse matrices are matrices that contain mostly zero values, and this program efficiently handles such matrices to conserve memory and improve performance.

## Features
- **Addition:** Perform addition of two sparse matrices.
- **Subtraction:** Perform subtraction of two sparse matrices.
- **Multiplication:** Perform multiplication of two sparse matrices.
- **Input from File:** Read matrix data from text files.
- **Efficient Storage:** Utilizes a dictionary-based approach to store only non-zero elements, saving memory for large sparse matrices.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Usage
1. **Clone the Repository:**
 	```
   git clone <repository-url>
	```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**
	```
	cd sparse-matrix-python
	```
3. **Run the program**
	```
	python3 matrix.py
	```
Follow the On-screen Instructions:
